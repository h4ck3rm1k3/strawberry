Build Requirements
------------------

The following requirements need to be fulfilled in order to build the
application using a dist tarball (RHEL package names in parenthesis):

* GNU make (make)
* C++ compiler (gcc-c++)
* OpenSSL library and header files (openssl-devel)
* Boost library and header files (boost-devel)
* optional: Doxygen (doxygen)

Packaging Requirements
----------------------

In order to build a dist tarball for the application the following external
software components need to be installed in addition to the build requirements
mentioned above:

* GNU Automake (automake)
* GNU Autoconf (autoconf)
* GNU Libtool (libtool, libtool-ltdl-devel)
* GNU bison (bison)
* GNU flex (flex)

Debian Packages
---------------

This program comes with its own Debian packaging scripts which may or may not
fully comply with the official Debian packaging requirements. These scripts can
be found in the 'debian' sub-directory. Binary packages can be built using
'dpkg-buildpackage'.

Building 
--------
run in bash ./autogen.sh to create the configure file from the checked in git configuration. This autogen also calls configure for you. 
run make afterwards to compile.
